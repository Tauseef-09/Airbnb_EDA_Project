# Airbnb_EDA_Project

Airbnb is an American company founded in 2008 that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals and tourism activities.

For this project we are analyzing Airbnbâ€™s New York City(NYC) data of 2019. NYC is not only the most famous city in the world but also top global destination for visitors drawn to its museums, entertainment, restaurants and commerce. According to the Office of New York State Comptroller, NYC hosted 66.6 million visitors in 2019.
